# Why Quantum Field Theory?

There are numerous reasons why one should endeavour to understand the complicated physical theory riddled with infinity landmines. For starters, all predictions made by the theory have turned out to be correct. A major test for a theory's utility is in its ability to make testable predictions, and whether those predictions match with experimental predictions. As Richard Feynman famously said in one of his many wonderful lectures, "it doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are; if it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong". 

Secondly, quantum field theory gives us an origin for three of the four fundamental interactions of our universe - the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions. 

Thirdly, the theory gives us an explanation for why every elementary particle of the same kind is, well, the same. A freshly minted proton out of a particle accelerator is exactly the same as one that is in a neutron star far far away. How does nature produce identical particles? How come there are no "defects" in this production process? Quantum field theory has an answer for us.

Lastly, the theory offers an interesting perspective on how particles gain mass. The theory suggests that all particles are massless, and that particles like electrons gain their mass via the Higgs mechanism (yes, the so-called God particle). 

There are numerous other reasons why studying quantum field theory is a worthwhile activity. It is an extremely versatile tool that we can use to understand condensed matter physics and even financial markets. 

Hopefully, that serves as sufficient motivation for us to learn this beautiful, infinity-riddled theory of nature.
